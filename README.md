Rutgers CS 416 : Operating Systems - Design and Concepts.
This repository serves to host class projects.

Projects two, three, and four may merit attention.

In the second project, we have designed a user level multithreading library featuring a Multi-level feedback queue scheduler.

The third project features a two level paging scheme and includes a Least Recently Used eviction policy and a Translation Lookaside Buffer cache.
