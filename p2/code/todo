The Goal of March 14 is to ensure our Library Functions and Mutexes things work as specified.

more rough work:
- See discord p2 function isBLocked.
- We must imbue this into the schedule() function.

Then proceed:
=============

- Correct & Clean up mutex_list.c: 
    - Use constants #define
    - Consistency in style
    - Correctness of logic traced through
    - malloc and free accounting properly.

- Port mutex_list.c into thread-worker.c

- Ensure tcb list logic for join and exit logically sound.
    - malloc and free accounting proper.

- Clean up code as it looks in thread-worker.c

- Create a few test functions to ensure correctness:
    - test1: main spawns one child and waits for it to terminate. worker calls exit.
    - test2: test1 union (main needs to see the return value). worker calls exit.
    - test3: main spawns two children and each yield correctly.
    - test4: main spawns two children and waits for both to terminate and prints their return values.

- After ensuring correctness of logical flow for Library functions, test mutual exclusion.
    - test1: main creates locks, uses it, and deletes it.
    - test2: main creates two locks, uses both, deletes both - list should work
    - test3: test2 + another lock
    - test4: main spawns two threads, both compete for locks, main joins both.

= Note that some bugs may only be uncovered after preemption is uncovered.
    - That is why a logical overview will require careful logical scrutiny.
